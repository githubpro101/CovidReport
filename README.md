How to Generate an Analytics Report (pdf) in Python! 
by Keith Galli

original sourcecode: https://github.com/keithgalli/generate-analytics-report
you can get original files in zip folder there

newreport5.1.py is modification with error fixed (date, file location) (this is what shown in the video with errors fixed)
However when you redo it file location will change. so rewatch the original video in the place. 

* I modified helper.py from original to get dynamic data
** I fixed date modification error
